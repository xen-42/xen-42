Hey!

I created an open source Outer Wilds modding tool which allows for the creation and manipulation of planets and stars either through JSON or with an API. We have a main repo, examples project, template, GUI editor, and more on our organization: [New Horizons](https://github.com/Outer-Wilds-New-Horizons).

I also help run the infrastructure for [Outer Wilds Mods](https://github.com/ow-mods) including the [website](https://outerwildsmods.com/), mod manager, database, and more.

I created a [mod manager](https://github.com/DREDGE-Mods/DredgeModManager) and [database](https://github.com/DREDGE-Mods/DredgeModDatabase) for distributing DREDGE mods including my own multiplayer mod, [Cosmic Horror Fishing Buddies](https://dredgemods.com/mods/cosmic_horror_fishing_buddies/). Find out more on [dredgemods.com](https://dredgemods.com/)

I'm also making a DREDGE VR mod, early access available on my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/xen42)
