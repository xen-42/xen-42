Hey!

A few of the projects I've created:
- [Asteroid Arcade](https://github.com/xen-42/Asteroid-Arcade): a space themed shoot-em up for Android or web browser.
- [Voxel based procedural terrain generation](https://github.com/xen-42/Minecraft-Clone) in Godot.
- [Gerstner waves](https://github.com/xen-42/godot-waves-buoyancy) in Godot.
- [Mockbuster Video](https://github.com/xen-42/MockbusterVideo): a tongue-in-cheek management simulator browser game written in Godot.

I've made a bunch of Outer Wilds mods:
- Camera mods: [Third Person Camera](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-third-person-camera), [Static Camera](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-static-camera), which both use my [Common Camera Utility](https://github.com/xen-42/ow-common-camera-util).
- Some reimaginings of base game content: [Daydream](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-day-dream), [Visible Stranger](https://github.com/xen-42/ow-decloaked), [Ghostbuster](https://github.com/xen-42/ow-ghostbuster), [Signals+](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-signals-plus).
- Some content mods: [Real Solar System](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-real-solar-system), [New Horizons Examples](https://github.com/Outer-Wilds-New-Horizons/nh-examples).
- [Outer Wilds Achievements+](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-achievement-tracker): An achievement tracker for Outer Wilds and for custom modded achievements.
- Some jokes: [Outer Wario](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-wario), [Outer Thomas the Tank Engine](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-tank-engine), [Wrong title](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-cursed-title), [Majoras Mask's Moon](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-majoras-mask).

I created an organization for [New Horizons](https://github.com/Outer-Wilds-New-Horizons), an Outer Wilds modding tool allowing the creation and manipulation of planets and stars. We have a main repo, examples project, template, GUI editor, and more over there.

I also help run the infrastructure for [Outer Wilds Mods](https://github.com/ow-mods) including the [website](https://outerwildsmods.com/), mod manager, database, and more.

I have a [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/xen-dev/videos) where I showcase Godot and Unity projects I've worked on.
