Hey!

I created an organization for [New Horizons](https://github.com/Outer-Wilds-New-Horizons), an open source Outer Wilds modding tool allowing the creation and manipulation of planets and stars. We have a main repo, examples project, template, GUI editor, and more over there.

I also help run the infrastructure for [Outer Wilds Mods](https://github.com/ow-mods) including the [website](https://outerwildsmods.com/), mod manager, database, and more. All open source.
