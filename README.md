Hey!

My website and resume: https://xen-42.github.io/

A few of the projects I've created:
- [Asteroid Arcade](https://github.com/xen-42/Asteroid-Arcade): a space themed shoot-em up for Android or web browser.
- [Voxel based procedural terrain generation](https://github.com/xen-42/Minecraft-Clone) in Godot.
- [Gerstner waves](https://github.com/xen-42/godot-waves-buoyancy) in Godot.
- [Mockbuster Video](https://github.com/xen-42/MockbusterVideo): a tongue-in-cheek management simulator browser game written in Godot.
- [Third Person Camera](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-third-person-camera) for Outer Wilds.

I'm currently working on:
- My [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/xen-dev/videos) where I showcase Godot and Unity projects I've worked on.
- [New Horizons](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-new-horizons): An Outer Wilds modding tool allowing the creation and manipulation of planets and stars.
